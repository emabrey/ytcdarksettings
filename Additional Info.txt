This userstyle is only a modification that makes the <abbr title="Youtube Center">YTC</abbr> extension/userscript and the <abbr title="Youtube - Lights Out - A Dark Youtube Theme">YLO Theme</abbr> userstyle compatible with one another. By default, the settings popup of <abbr title="Youtube Center">YTC</abbr> is all white and clashes quite severely with the dark colors of the <abbr title="Youtube - Lights Out - A Dark Youtube Theme">YLO Theme</abbr>. This userstyle applies the main and secondary colors of the <abbr title="Youtube - Lights Out - A Dark Youtube Theme">YLO Theme</abbr> to the settings popup of <abbr title="Youtube Center">YTC</abbr>, bringing the clashing white on black conflict to a rightful end.

The license terms of the <abbr title="Youtube - Lights Out - A Dark Youtube Theme">YLO Theme</abbr> requires me to give appropriate credit to Draxx7, who authored that userstyle and made it available <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/92164/youtube-lights-out-a-dark-youtube-theme">here</a>. Note that Draxx7 is not affiliated with this userstyle and that I am not affiliated with the <abbr title="Youtube - Lights Out - A Dark Youtube Theme">YLO Theme</abbr>. I want to personally thank Draxx7 for his userstyle however, as I use it personally and enjoy the aesthetic very much. Note that because I consider this userstyle as incorporating major parts (essentially design elements like colors) of the <abbr title="Youtube - Lights Out - A Dark Youtube Theme">YLO Theme</abbr>, I am licensing my userstyle using <abbr title="Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike">CC BY-NC-SA</abbr>. Click <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/">here</a> to get a copy of the <abbr title="Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike">CC BY-NC-SA</abbr> license (redistribution is a required part of license compliance).

<abbr title="Youtube Center">YTC</abbr> is not mine either; however it is <a href="https://github.com/YePpHa/YouTubeCenter/blob/master/LICENSE.md">available under the MIT license</a> via Jeppe Rune Mortensen. I absolutely want to thank Jeppe for his extension because it is one of the most necessary parts of my Youtube experience. If I did not have <abbr title="Youtube Center">YTC</abbr> odds are I would rarely if ever surf Youtube. You can get <abbr title="Youtube Center">YTC</abbr> via the Github hosted wiki <a href="https://github.com/YePpHa/YouTubeCenter/wiki">here</a> (I recommend using the developer version in the form of a userscript, but a native extension may be your preference).
