This project contains the CSS and related files for the [*Lights Out & Youtube Center Compatibility Fix* userstyle][1] which are licensed via the [Creative Commons  Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International](license.md) license. You can find this and other userstyles at [userstyles.org][2], which also contains instructions for how to configure your browser to use the *Stylish* extension (Browser Specific Installation: [[Mozilla Firefox]][3] [[Google Chrome]][4]).

The [*Lights Out & Youtube Center Compatibility Fix* userstyle][1] contains the CSS needed to make the settings popup of the [*Youtube Center* extension][5] (by Jeppe Rune Mortensen) stylistically similar to the style of the [*Youtube - Lights Out - A Dark Youtube Theme*][6] (by [Draxx7][7]). Before this userstyle is applied the light coloration of *Youtube Center* conflicts with the dark coloration of [*Youtube - Lights Out - A Dark Youtube Theme*][6]; this style homogenizes the user interface to be consistent with the dark style (specifically the settings popup of *Youtube Center* is altered and not other page elements).

The license terms of [*Youtube - Lights Out - A Dark Youtube Theme*][6] requires me to give appropriate credit to the author [Draxx7][7]. Note that [Draxx7][7] is not affiliated with this userstyle and that I also am not associated with his userstyles. I also want to thank Jeppe Rune Mortensen for making *Youtube Center* available [via the MIT license][8]. I personally use both of these authors creations and I want to extend a thanks to each of them for their great work.

If you find any bugs or want to request a feature, please create an issue via [Github][9] and at your option include a pull request implementing changes. If you require an alternative license then please submit your requirements via a feature request.
